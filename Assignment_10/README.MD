# Fraction, Time, and Date Classes 

## Introduction

This Python code defines three classes: `Fraction`, `Time`, and `Date`. These classes provide basic functionality for working with fractions, times, and dates.

**Fraction Class**

The `Fraction` class represents mathematical fractions. It offers methods for creating fractions, performing arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and string representation.

**Key Features:**

- **Initialization:** The constructor `__init__` takes a string in the format `"numerator/denominator"` (e.g., `"3/4"`) to create a `Fraction` object.
- **String Representation:** The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the fraction in the same format as the input (e.g., `"3/4"`).
- **Multiplication (`__mul__`):** Multiplies two `Fraction` objects and returns a new `Fraction` object representing the product.
- **True Division (`__truediv__`):** Performs true division (division without regard to the remainder) between two `Fraction` objects and returns a new `Fraction` object representing the quotient.
- **Addition (`__add__`):** Adds two `Fraction` objects and returns a new `Fraction` object representing the sum.
- **Subtraction (`__sub__`):** Subtracts two `Fraction` objects and returns a new `Fraction` object representing the difference.

**Example Usage:**

```python
fraction1 = Fraction("3/4")
fraction2 = Fraction("1/2")

product = fraction1 * fraction2
print(product)  # Output: 3/8

quotient = fraction1 / fraction2
print(quotient)  # Output: 3/2

sum_fraction = fraction1 + fraction2
print(sum_fraction)  # Output: 5/4

difference = fraction1 - fraction2
print(difference)  # Output: 1/4
```

**Limitations:**

- The current implementation assumes the input string for the fraction is in the format `"numerator/denominator"`, with both parts being integers. It would require further modification to handle more complex input formats or floating-point numbers.

**Time Class**

The `Time` class is currently a placeholder with an empty constructor `__init__`. It includes unimplemented methods for addition (`__add__`) and subtraction (`__sub__`). Adding functionalities for time calculations would require defining attributes like `seconds`, `minutes`, and `hours` and implementing suitable logic within the addition and subtraction methods.

**Date Class**

The `Date` class also acts as a placeholder with an empty constructor `__init__`. It includes unimplemented methods for addition (`__add__`), subtraction (`__sub__`), and calendar conversion (`convert_calender`). Similar to the `Time` class, implementing these functionalities would involve defining appropriate attributes like `day`, `month`, and `year`, along with logic for handling date manipulation and calendar conversions.

**Next Steps**

- Implement the missing methods in the `Time` and `Date` classes to enable time and date calculations.
- Consider adding error handling to the `Fraction` class to validate input format and handle potential exceptions.
